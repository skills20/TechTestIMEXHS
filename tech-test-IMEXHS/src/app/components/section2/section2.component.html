  <h2>High-Level Architecture:</h2>
  <ol type="1">
    <li>
      <strong>Authentication Module:</strong> Responsible for user
      authentication, ensuring only radiologists can access the system.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Study Management Module:</strong> Handles the storage and
      retrieval of radiological study information.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Questionnaire Module:</strong> Manages the questionnaire for
      radiologists to fill out about each study.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Statistics Module:</strong> Provides endpoints for HIS to retrieve
      statistics about studies read by radiologists.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Data Encryption Module:</strong> Ensures sensitive patient
      information is encrypted.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Communication Module:</strong> Responsible for communicating with
      the HIS for sending study results.

  <h2>Information Flows:</h2>
  <ol type="1">
    <li>Receiving New Radiological Study:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        When the HIS sends a JSON message, the system receives it and stores the
        information.
      </li>
      <li>
        Patient information (e.g., name, age) is encrypted before storage.
      </li>
      <li>Study details are stored as they are.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Radiologist Workflow:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Radiologists authenticate to access the system.</li>
      <li>They see a list of pending studies and choose one.</li>
      <li>
        They answer the questionnaire, which includes questions about water
        volume and findings.
      </li>
      <li>
        Responses, along with the date and the radiologist's user ID, are stored
        in the system.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <li>Reading Study Submission:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        When a radiologist submits a form, the system sends a POST request to
        HIS with the necessary data, including an authorization header.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <li>Statistics:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        HIS can make GET requests to the statistics endpoint with specific
        parameters.
      </li>
      <li>
        The system processes the requests and returns statistics in JSON format.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </ol>
